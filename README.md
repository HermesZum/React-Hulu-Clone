## Instructions

We must create the `.env.local` file inside the project root.

Next, we need a `API_KEY` from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

Now we go to the `.env.local `file and configure the `API_KEY`:

```plaintext
API_KEY=00000d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0
```
When deploying, you have to add your **key** to the platform variables or the app doesn't work.
